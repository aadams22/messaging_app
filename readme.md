Encrypted Messaging App Rebuild

##Overview
Enigmatic is an encrypted private messaging web application that allows the user to privately message their friends with visual privacy. User is able to message their friends or colleagues and the message shows up encrypted on the front-end. To decrypt the message, the user only needs to hover over the message. When the cursor is no longer over the message, the message is immediately replaced with the encrypted version and the decryption is removed from the front-end. All decryption and encryption occurs server side.
